to do BL = 1111 1111 :
 PUSH 0X0
 POP EBX
 DEC EBX
 => bin(BL) 1111 1111

then went through the steps :
1.encode: every non ASCII --> xor with 0xff
2.decoder: xor with BL and keep track bu inc ecx
3.get_ascii_shellcode: for getting the right address , ESP- (len(shellcode)+4)
and dec EAX the same number of times
4.get_payload:same as q2
