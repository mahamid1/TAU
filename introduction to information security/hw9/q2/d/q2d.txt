winston:
*we get the message in bytes
*calculate number of messages to send
*the i packet we create where the seq is index i and ack is the number of packets
*we shift right 3 times the msg_int so we take the last 3 bits
*send the pacakets with sr


julia:
*filter='lo' so we listen to local host
*stealth is the function that checks the src port and flags
*we get the packets count from the ack and the index from the seq field and the 3 bits
*update the variables and stop sniffing
