generate:
*build the packets with the given ip and dst and with the given port as dst ports in TCP
we crate the packets:
IP Level is the dst ip
TCP level is the dst port and the flag is 'S'(the packet is syn packet)


analyze:
*the packets in unanswered were filtered,the rest  of the packets :
1.the port is open ---->SYN-ACK response. the tcp flags is 18 and we add them with OPEN
2.we add them with CLOSED
